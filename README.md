# CodeAlpha_Task
The Task Automation project is a Python-based application designed to help users automate repetitive tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency. With this app, users can easily create and schedule automated tasks such as sending emails, organizing files, and executing scripts. The application offers a simple interface that allows you to define tasks, set triggers, and specify the desired actions, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users.

This application features a task scheduler that runs tasks at specified intervals or times, ensuring that important actions are completed without manual intervention. Users can monitor task status and receive notifications when tasks are executed, providing a clear overview of automation activities. Additionally, the app supports logging, which keeps a record of all completed tasks, helping users track their automation history and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, and install the required packages. Once everything is set up, you can run the application and follow the instructions to create and manage your automated tasks. This project is designed to streamline your workflow and free up your time for more important activities.
