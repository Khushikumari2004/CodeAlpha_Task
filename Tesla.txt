Elon Musk unveiled Tesla's Cybercab prototypes, with production expected in 2026 at under $30,000, alongside a Robovan concept for 20 passengers.

Elon Musk unveiled long-awaited prototypes of a Tesla Inc. robotaxi called Cybercab, saying production may start in 2026 and that the vehicle could cost less than $30,000.

The chief executive officer hitched a ride in one of the two-door sedans on his way to the stage at the carmakerâ€™s event late Thursday in Burbank, California. Musk also showcased a futuristic-looking Robovan concept that he said could transport 20 people at a time.

Tesla has a track record of blowing past timelines Musk has offered for all manner of future products, and the robotaxi event itself was delayed two months after he ordered changes to the prototype, Bloomberg first reported in July. The unveiling itself got underway almost an hour behind schedule.

Musk told the crowd gathered at a Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. movie studio lot that consumers will be able to buy the Cybercab, then offered a hedged answer when someone in the crowd shouted to ask when it would be available.
